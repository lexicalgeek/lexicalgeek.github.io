In 1975, the world was a much different place. 
- Gerald Ford was president. 
- The median household income in the United States was just under twelve thousand dollars. 
- "I'm Sorry" by John Denver was the #1 single. 
- "All in the Family" was the most popular television program. 
- Facebook CEO Billionaire Mark Zuckerberg was negative nine and a half years old. 
- And my dad, David Watters, spent the summer growing a creepy upper lip to match the jacket he won during a barfight with a hobo who used to work for the circus.    
My point is this: 1975 was totally lame. Until...


October 6th, the day my mom joined United. It's crazy to think that it's been more than 40 years since the skies upped their friendliness by adding a half-Japanese dance major who hugs everyone the first time she meets them. And I mean *everyone.* I've never seen her hug a Metra employee, but I don't ride the train with her in the morning, so I'm not ruling it out.

- For many, the 1970s was the golden age of commercial flight, but waxing poetic about days gone by is more nostalgic delusion than historical fact. How soon we forget just how difficult it was to travel back when my Mom first entered the industry.
- From the cardboard, freeze-dried food to the
- The insufferably long lines at the airport ticket kiosks and security checkpoints...to the 
- Troll-like, Nurse Ratched Flight Attendants who ruled the cabin with an iron fist.

And THIS is was the milieu in which my mom cut her teeth as an Airline industry professional. 

Luckily for me, it also meant that for the first 26 years of my life, I never knew a time without flight benefits.

In March of 1990, when most kids were piling into their parents' minivan for the 5-hour drive to Wisconsin Dells, my siblings and I were sitting at the kitchen table, looking at the last page of the first section of the Daily Herald because my Mom said "point to somewhere on the map and that's where we're going for spring break." 

- My freshman year in college, my buddies were barely subsisting on ramen 
- While I took first class flights home to and from Salt Lake City every 5 weeks just to see my orthodontist.

- Before even starting kindergarten, I had flown over the ocean and dined on Hawaiian steak on a first-class ticket to Honolulu. 
- Unfortunately, I had a sensitive stomach, and the revenue passenger next to me ended up wearing that steak as a result of my dietary indiscretions.

- So while I enjoy giving the airlines a hard time, I couldn't feel more fortunate to have grown up in an airline family. 
- When I was a kid, not a single member of my extended family lived less than 1000 miles away. For most, that would mean never really knowing your grandparents, cousins, or aunts and uncles. But because United made flight so trivial, I often felt I visited my relatives more often than did my friends who had grandparents who lived in Skokie. The standby hassles, the write-your-own travel tickets, the carry-on rollerboards, the clip-on ties, the deep-seated deferential politeness to every CSR on the planet--this was the glue that bound an exceptionally large extended family that spanned half the country's width. 

- Moreover, I don't think I could be more fortunate to have spent the last 35 years with Linda Watters. Sure she's proven to be an almost insanely devoted United employee, but more importantly, she's the best Mom, wife, daughter, and Gigi anyone could ever ask for.

I'm very proud of you Mom, and I love you very much. Aloha!
