Since my sister already provided the backstory to my mom's long career with United, I offer only a few additional memories of growing up an airline brat and perhaps some context as to just how long 40 years really is.

I'd like to take you back to 1975. The world was a different place. 
- Gerald Ford was president. 
- The median household income in the United States was just under twelve thousand dollars. 
- "I'm Sorry" by John Denver was the #1 single. 
- "All in the Family" was the most popular television program. 
- Facebook CEO Billionaire Mark Zuckerberg was negative nine and a half. 
- And my dad, David Watters, spent the summer watering the growing a creepy upper lip to match the jacket he won during a barfight with a hobo who used to work for the circus.    
My point is this: 1975 was totally lame. Until...


October 6th, the day my mom joined United. It's crazy to think that it's been more than 40 years since the skies upped their friendliness by adding a half-Japanese dance major who hugs everyone the first time she meets them. And I mean *everyone.* And while many weary travelers may wax poetic about the golden age of commercial airlines, how soon they forget just how difficult it was to travel back when my Mom first entered the industry.

- From the cardboard, freeze-dried food to the
- The insufferably long lines at the airport to the
- Troll-like, Nurse Ratched Flight Attendants who ruled the cabin with an iron fist.

And THIS is was the milieu in which my mom cut her teeth as an Airline industry professional. 

Luckily for me, it also meant that for the first 26 years of my life, I never knew a time without flight benefits.

When most kids were piling into their parents' minivan for the 5-hour drive to Wisconsin Dells, my siblings and I were sitting at the kitchen table, looking at the last page of the first section of the Daily Herald because my Mom said "point to somewhere on the map and that's where we're going for spring break." 

My freshman year in college, my buddies were barely subsisting while I took first class flights home to and from Salt Lake City every 5 weeks for my orthodontist appointments.
