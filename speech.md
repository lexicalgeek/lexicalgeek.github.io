Since my sister already provided the backstory to my mom's long career with United, I offer only a few additional memories of growing up an airline brat and perhaps some context as to just how long 40 years really is.

I'd like to take you back to 1975. The world was a different place. 
- Gerald Ford was president. 
- The median household income in the United States was just under twelve thousand dollars. 
- "I'm Sorry" by John Denver was the #1 single. 
- "All in the Family" was the most popular television program. 
- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was negative nine and a half. 
- And my dad, David Watters, spent the summer watering the growth on his upper lip to match the jacket he won during a barfight with a hobo who used to work for the circus.    
My point is this: 1975 was totally lame. Until...

It's crazy to think that it's been more than 40 years since the skies upped their friendliness by adding a half-Japanese dance major who hugs everyone the first time she meets them.

- From the cardboard, freeze-dried food to the
- The insufferably long lines at the airport to the
- Troll-like, Nurse Ratched Flight Attendants who ruled the cabin with an iron fist.

This is the airline industry where my Mom cut her teeth, and it's because she got her start in the fall 5 years before the birth of her favorite child that I was able to take the precious gift of flight and travel for granted.
